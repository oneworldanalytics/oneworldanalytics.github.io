Since 2013 we have worked on a number of studies for the [ABS Initiative](http://www.abs-initiative.info) focusing on access and benefit-sharing in Africa. 

In the first stage we reviewed patent activity for biodiversity and traditional knowledge for 15 African countries. 

In the second stage we mapped the scientific landscape for research involving biodiversity and traditional knowledge using the scientific literature. This has led to the development of a set of individual landscapes and a regional landscape.
