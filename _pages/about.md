One World Analytics was founded in 2013 as a research company that uses innovative
approaches to the analysis of global social and environmental issues. We use a
combination of text mining, statistics, geographic mapping and network analysis to make the
invisible and the neglected visible.

We have a strong commitment to working with developing countries to address
knowledge and capacity needs that will contribute to economic development and
conservation of the environment. This commitment gets us out of the bed in the
morning and is the animating principle behind what we do.

Most of the work we do is intended to inform policy decision-making. We mainly
focus on research that informs:

- [The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/) 
- The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable
Sharing of the Benefits Arising from Their Utilization (the [Nagoya
Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/about/) for short) 
- [The Plant Treaty](http://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/en/) (the International
Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture) 
- The United Nations General Assembly (in connection with the
conservation of biodiversity and access to genetic resources in Areas Beyond
National Jurisdiction which is handled under the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea. If that sounds complicated it is because it is) 
- The World Intellectual Property Organization. 
  - In 2015 we prepared the WIPO Patent Landscape Report on Animal Genetic
  Resources to inform the work of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. 
  - In 2016 Paul Oldham wrote the [WIPO Manual on Open Source Patent Analytics](https://wipo-analytics.github.io/) 
  - Paul Oldham serves as a WIPO expert for training in patent analytics 
  - We regularly present research (in collaboration with the
United Nations University Institute for Advanced Study of Sustainability or
UNU-IAS) at the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and
Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (the IGC).
