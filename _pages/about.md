One World Analytics was founded in 2013 as a company that uses innovative approaches to the analysis of global social and environmental issues. We use a combination of text mining, statistics, mapping and network analysis to make the invisible and the neglected visible. 

The majority of our work is concerned with pushing the boundaries in the use of social and environmental data to inform international policy debates. 

We have a strong commitment to working with developing countries to address knowledge and capacity needs that will contribute to economic development and conservation of the environment. This commitment gets us out of the bed in the morning and is the animating principle behind what we do.

A lot of the work that we do informs debates at the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity along with the Plant Treaty, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the World Intellectal Property Organisation. However, we measure our success on whether our work contributes to community based development or the capacity of developing countries to address their needs.
