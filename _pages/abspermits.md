In 2015 as part of a project on national implementation of the Nagoya Protocol in the Bahamas with the Bahamas Environment, Science and Technology Commission (BEST), Paul Oldham wrote a paper outlining a national system for compliance and monitoring. In 2016 with support from the [ABS Initiative](http://www.abs-initiative.info) the paper was further developed with inputs from Olivier Rukundo (legal) and Hartmut Meyer. 

The concept paper and related schematics are available from a separate [research permits website](http://abspermits.net/) and will be updated as the project develops.
