In 2015 as part of a project on national implementation of the Nagoya Protocol in the Bahamas with the Bahamas Environment, Science and Technology Commission (BEST), Paul Oldham wrote a paper outlining a national system for compliance and monitoring focusing on an online research permit system. In 2016 with support from the [ABS Initiative](http://www.abs-initiative.info) the paper was further developed with inputs from Olivier Rukundo and Hartmut Meyer. 

The concept paper and related schematics for a model online research permit system are available from a separate [research permits website](http://abspermits.net/) and will be updated as the project develops.
