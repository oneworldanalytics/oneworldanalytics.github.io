We have published quite a bit since we started back in 2013 and we make as much as possible publicly available. A lot of the publications are available below and some, such as our work on access and benefit-sharing in Africa, form large chunks of work. We will organise these by sections. Where you see a link to a Tableau workbook you can either explore the data in the iframe on the page or head over to the Tableau Public workspace. 

All of our published work is available free of charge and all we ask is that you provide an attribution back to the source if you use it. Wherever the work does not involve someone elses intellectual property we will make the underlying data available on our GitHub repository.
