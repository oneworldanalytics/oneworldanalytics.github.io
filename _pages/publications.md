We have published quite a bit since we started back in 2013. Where you see a link to a
Tableau workbook you can head over to the Tableau Public workspace.

All of our published work is available free of charge and all we ask is that you
provide an attribution back to the source if you use it. 

Most One World Analytics publications can also be found on Paul Oldham's home
page at [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Oldham2) and
some of Paul's wider work is available through [Google Scholar
citations](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wQvG7eoAAAAJ&hl=en). We
will provide direct links to our key publications below. 

**Upcoming**

Paul Oldham has written the WIPO Manual on Open Source Patent Analytics. The
Manual was written in Rmarkdown using RStudio and chapters were published as
they were written. You can access the prepublication articles from the [Github
website](https://wipo-analytics.github.io). We expect the final version to come
out in late 2016 or early 2017.
